# Worked Examples

All the examples are also available as Jupyter notebooks and can be downloaded here:

Some notebooks are completely self-contained:
they generate the data and analyze it with Stacie.
Other notebooks process the output of external simulation codes.
Input files are provided for these simulations,
which you must run before such notebooks can be used.

The rendered notebooks, including all outputs, are included in the following sections.
