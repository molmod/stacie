# # Bulk viscosity of a Lennard-Jones Liquid Near the Triple Point (LAMMPS)
#
# This example shows how to compute the bulk viscosity
# of a Lennard-Jones liquid near the triple point using LAMMPS.
# This example is based on the [Viscosity of the Lennard-Jones liquid](lj_viscosity.py)
# notebook. Just uses different components of the LAMMPS output to compute the bulk viscosity.
