# How to Detect Insufficient Data

CONCEPT:

- Explain that the algorithm will typically understimate the integral when sequences are too short.
  (Also refer to example in the literature.)
- Discuss typical artifacts when there is too little data.
  The peak at zero frequency has to be resolved well.
- When taking too large block sums, one gets white noise.
  Risk for overfitting
