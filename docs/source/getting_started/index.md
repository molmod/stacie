# Getting Started

Stacie is a Python software library that can be used interactively in a Jupyter Notebook
or can be embedded non-interactively in larger computational workflows.

To get started, you will need to:

- Install the `stacie` Python library (see [installation](installation.md)),
- Understand and accept the [open source licenses](licenses.md) we use,
- Get a bird's eye view of [how to use](usage.md) Stacie,
- Know how to [cite](cite.md) Stacie when using it in your research.

A basic understanding of the [theory](../theory/index.md) is highly recommended
to ensure that you get the right result for the right reason.
The documentation contains several [worked examples](../examples/index.md)
that you can use as a starting point for your own research.
