# Getting Started

Stacie is a Python software library that can be used interactively in a Jupyter Notebook,
or can be embedded non-interactively in larger computational workflows.

The algorithms in Stacie are robust enough to make reliable estimates of autocorrelation integrals
without any user invention.
Hence, there is no need to tweak its settings interactively through a graphical user interface.
At best, some settings may be refined to improve the computational efficiency of the calculations.
