CONCEPT:

- Simple theoretical model to generate data with known time constant.
  (Something without celerite, e.g. minimalistic langevin oscillator.)
- Example script to generate the data.
- Example script of the analysis with Stacie.
- Main goal is to show the Python functions for estimation and plotting.
- Stacie is unit-agnostic, but has support for units in plot function.
- Comment on data serialization and refer to `stacie.msgpack` for details.
- Comment on block summing and refer to section.
