# Welcome to STACIE's Documentation

STACIE is a *STable AutoCorrelation Integral Estimator*.

STACIE is developed in the context of a collaboration between
the [Center for Molecular Modeling](https://molmod.ugent.be/)
and the tribology group of [Labo Soete](https://www.ugent.be/ea/emsme/en/research/soete)
at [Ghent University](https://ugent.be/).
STACIE is open source software (LGPL-v3 license) and is made available via
[GitHub](https://molmod.ugent.be/).

In this online documentation, you will find all the practical instructions on how to use STACIE,
and the theory needed to understand what STACIE computes and how it works.
