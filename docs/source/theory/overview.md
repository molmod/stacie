# Overview

## Continuous time

CONCEPT:

- Define time-dependent function, Gaussian process
- Define ACF.
- Define the integral of interest, introce symbol for it.
- Draw connection with zero-freq limit of analytical FT.

## Discretized time

CONCEPT:

- Sample = finite number of finite-length sequences
- Power spectrum + our normalization
- Zero freq limit of interest.
- Remark on (lack of) periodicity.
