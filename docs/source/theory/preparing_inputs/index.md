# Preparing inputs

This section discusses how to prepare input sequences for STACIE
to guarantee high-quality results.
It consists of three parts:

- How to plan and prepare [sufficient input sequences](data_sufficiency.md) for STACIE.
- How to store sequences efficiently on disk with [block averages](block_averages.md).
- How to perform [molecular dynamics](molecular_dynamics.md) simulations
  to obtain suitable inputs for STACIE.
