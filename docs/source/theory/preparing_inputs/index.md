This section discusses how to prepare input sequences for STACIE
to guarantee high-quality results.
It consists of two parts:

- How to plan and prepare [sufficient input sequences](sufficient_data.md) for STACIE.
- How to store sequences efficiently on disk with [block averages](block_averages.md).
