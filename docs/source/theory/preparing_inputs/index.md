# Preparing inputs

This section discusses how to prepare input sequences for STACIE
to guarantee high-quality results:

- We first discuss how to prepare [sufficiently long input sequences](sufficient_data.md)
  for STACIE.
- Efficient storage of trajectory data is discussed in the section on [block averages](block_averages.md)
