# Theory

This section outlines the theoretical foundations of STACIE
and provides recommendations for its effective use.
It is divided into three parts:

1. An explanation of the mathematical foundations of STACIE,
   specifically how it computes [autocorrelation integrals](autocorrelation_integral/index.md).
2. Recommendations for [preparing inputs](preparing_inputs/index.md)
   to efficiently obtain high-quality results with STACIE.
3. A description of the [properties](properties/index.md)
   that STACIE can derive from the {term}`ACF` and its integral.
