# Theory

The theory section consists of three parts:

1. A section on the estimation of the mathematical foundations of STACIE, i.e.,
   how it integrates [autocorrelation integrals](autocorrelation_integral/index.md) in general.
2. A section on [properties](properties/index.md) that can be derived
   from the {term}`ACF` and its integral using STACIE.
3. Recommendations for [preparing inputs](preparing_inputs/index.md) for STACIE,
   to efficiently obtain high-quality results.
