# Theory

The theory section consists of three parts:

1. A section on the estimation of
   [autocorrelation integrals](autocorrelation_integral/index.md) in general.
2. A section on [properties](properties/index.md) that can be derived
   from the autocorrelation function and its integral.
3. Recommendations for [preparing inputs](preparing_inputs/index.md),
   to efficiently obtain high-quality results with STACIE.
