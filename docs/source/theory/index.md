# Theory

The theory section deals only with the integral of the autocorrelation function as such.
It does not cover any specifics of the (physical) properties associated with this integral.
Some of the derivations in the theory section can also be found in other references.
They are included here to make the theory more accessible
and to explain all the details needed to implement Stacie.
