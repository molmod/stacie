# Theory

The theory section consists of three parts:

1. A section on the estimation of
   [autocorrelation integrals](autocorrelation_integral/index.md) in general.
2. A section on [properties](properties/index.md) that can be deduced
   from the autocorrelation function and its integral.
3. A few [advanced topics](advanced_topics/index.md),
   mainly relevant for high-quality production simulations.
