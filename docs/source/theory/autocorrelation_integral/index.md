# Autocorrelation Integral

This theory section deals only with the integral of the autocorrelation function as such.
The (physical) [properties](../properties/index.md) associated with this integral
are discussed in the next section.

Some of the derivations in the theory section can also be found in other references.
They are included here to make the theory more accessible
and to explain all the details needed to implement Stacie.
