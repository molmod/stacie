Any linear time-invariant operation on s(t) produces a new spectrum of the form H(f)\u2022S(f), which changes the relative magnitudes and/or angles (phase) of the non-zero values of S(f). Any other type of operation creates new frequency components that may be referred to as <b>spectral leakage</b> in the broadest sense. Sampling, for instance, produces leakage, which we call <i>aliases</i> of the original spectral component. For Fourier transform purposes, sampling is modeled as a product between s(t) and a Dirac comb function. The spectrum of a product is the convolution between S(f) and another function, which inevitably creates the new frequency components. But the term 'leakage' usually refers to the effect of <i>windowing</i>, which is the product of s(t) with a different kind of function, the window function. Window functions happen to have finite duration, but that is not necessary to create leakage.
