STACIE is a Python package and algorithm that computes time integrals of autocorrelation functions.
It is primarily designed for post-processing molecular dynamics simulations.
However, it can also be used for more general analysis of time-correlated data.
Typical applications include estimating transport properties and
the uncertainty of averages over time-correlated data, as well as analyzing characteristic timescales.

All information about STACIE can be found in the [documentation](https://molmod.github.io/stacie).
