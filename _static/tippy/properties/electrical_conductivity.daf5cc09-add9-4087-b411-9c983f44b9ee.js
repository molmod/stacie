consistent treatment of the pre-factors\ncan be challenging.\n(Literature references are not always consistent due to differences in notation.)\nOur derivation is general, i.e., for an arbitrary number of different <em>types</em>\nof charge carriers, which are not restricted to monovalent ions.</p><p>First, insert the expression for the charge current into the conductivity\nand then bring the

processing) all these data may require excessive resources.\nTo reduce the amount of data, we recommend taking block averages.\nThese block averages form a new time series with a time step equal to the block size\nmultiplied by the original time step.\nThey reduce storage requirements by a factor equal to the block size.\nIf the program generating the sequences does not support block
